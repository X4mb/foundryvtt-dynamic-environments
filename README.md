# Foundry VTT - Dynamic Environments (PF2e)

A Foundry VTT module designed to enhance environmental realism, integrate with FXMaster for dynamic weather effects, and automate movement penalties for the Pathfinder 2nd Edition system based on indoor/outdoor status and prevailing weather conditions.

## Features (Planned)

* **Intelligent Weather FX:** Automatically mask FXMaster weather effects (rain, snow, etc.) when tokens are detected inside buildings.
* **Automated Movement Penalties:** Apply speed reductions to PF2e tokens when they are outdoors in challenging weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain, snow, blizzards).
* **User-Friendly Controls:** Simple GM controls to set current weather and customize penalties.

## Installation

1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the following modules installed and enabled in Foundry VTT:
    * [FXMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fxmaster)
    * [libWrapper](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-wrapper)
2.  **Manifest URL (Coming Soon!):** Once released, you will be able to install this module directly from Foundry's module browser using its manifest URL.
