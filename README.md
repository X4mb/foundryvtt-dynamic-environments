# Foundry VTT - Dynamic Environments (PF2e)

A Foundry VTT module designed to enhance environmental realism with foundrys dynamic weather effects, and automate movement penalties for the Pathfinder 2nd Edition system based on indoor/outdoor status and prevailing weather conditions.

## Features (Planned)

* **Intelligent Weather:** Automatically mask Foundry weather effects (rain, snow, etc.) when tokens are detected inside buildings.
* **Automated Movement Penalties:** Apply speed reductions to PF2e tokens when they are outdoors in challenging weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain, snow, blizzards).
* **User-Friendly Controls:** Simple GM controls to set current weather and customize penalties.

## Development

This module is actively under development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
